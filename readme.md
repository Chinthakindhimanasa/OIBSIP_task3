# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is part of a **Data Science Internship Task**.  
The objective is to predict the price of a car based on its various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, horsepower, and other specifications.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  
It contains information such as:

- Car brand & model  
- Year of manufacture  
- Mileage (km driven)  
- Engine & horsepower  
- Fuel type, Transmission type  
- Price (target variable)  

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Perform **data preprocessing** (handling null values, encoding categorical features, scaling)  
3. Analyze data using **visualizations** (price trends, brand impact, etc.)  
4. Train models using **Machine Learning algorithms** such as:  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Gradient Boosting  
5. Evaluate models with metrics like:  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R² Score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Results
- Built a machine learning model that predicts car prices with good accuracy.  
- Found key factors influencing car prices: **brand reputation, mileage, engine power, and age of the car**.
